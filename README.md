If you're reading this then I'm assuming you're interested in learning about how I made the API layer of my portfolio website! If you're looking for the UI, there's a personal-ui project on my projects page here that showcases the face of my portfolio.

Anyway, here you'll find an Actix-based API providing simple CRUD operations into a Postgres database containing the content of my portfolio. While of course more convoluted (and slightly more expensive) than rendering content directly into my React application, my intent was to showcase that there is absolutely more than one way to do something.

Absolutely feel free to reach out with any questions you might have. Thanks ᕙ(⇀‸↼‶)ᕗ
